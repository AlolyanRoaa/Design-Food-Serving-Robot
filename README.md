# Design-Food-Serving-Robot


3D design of the food serving robot project, this model supports the concept of the reusable model. 


As a preliminary plan, this robot will serve food and coffee, to do so we need to change and redesign some parts, so this concept will help reduce the cost for the project.


## Brief Description of The Design


The focus in this design is to make the robot nice and acceptable to serve visitors and customers, so the length of the robot will not exceed 150 cm, which is the appropriate length to serve customers, and this length will reduce the cost of transporting the robot.


The upper part of the robot's body was designed similar to the human body, in order to make it easier for the customer to choose clothes for the robot to wear as the customer likes.


Plastic material will be used in this project, and to increase support and to preserve safety, the robot will be provided with a set of supports as shown below.
